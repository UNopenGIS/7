## Objective 1: UN operation

### short description

Operationalize [[vector tiles]] in the UN

### overview

We introduce an effective and efficient geospatial data dissemination mechanism for the [[UN field missions]] and the [[UN Secretariat]]. It will be cost-saving for [[the Organization]].

### key initiatives

- [[Vector tile]] production from both UN and [[OpenStreetMap]] data (concordant with the [[UniteMap]].)
- Hosting [[vector tiles]] for open-source map libraries (such as [[MapLibre GL JS]]) and [[ArcGIS]] Geoportal.
- Develop elevation RGB raster tile ([[Terrain Tiles]]) from existing [[DEM]] and contour lines for 3D terrain maps.
- Continuous improvement of the data structure and map style for better operations.

### key performance indicators

#### Regular update of the [[vector tiles]]

##### current

daily for mission areas, twice a week for other areas

##### target

keep regular updates

## Objective 2: [[GSI]] operation

### short description

Operationalize GSI vector tiles in distributed hosting environments

### overview

We scale out map applications by promoting vector tile hosting by different parties including private enterprises.

### key initiatives

- Officially release [[GSI topographic vector tiles]]
- Promote tools to replicate and host [[GSI topographic vector tiles]]
- Promote distributed use of [[GSI topographic vector tiles]]
- Promote value-added applications of [[GSI topographic vector tiles]]

### key performance indicators

#### Number of tiles monthly sent from [[GSI]] server [tiles/month]

##### current

6 billion tiles/month

##### target

0% increase from 6 billion tiles/month in 2023-10

#### Number of operators hosting [[GSI topographic vector tiles]]

##### target

+3 in 2023-10

## Objective 3: [[UNVT Portable]]

### short description

Introduce [[UNVT Portable]] in [[local governments]]

### overview

We equip [[local governments]] with modern and portable [[web map]] services. We promote [[informed decision making]] by [[local governments]], [[residents]], and [[volunteers]] especially in [[disaster response]].

### key initiatives

- Support [[local governments]] introducing [[UNVT Portable]].
- Promote [[UNVT Portable]] by joining [[hackathons]] in the context of public use of [[ICT]].

### key performance indicators

- Number of [[local governments]] we approached
- Number of [[hackathons]] we participated

## [Objective 4](https://github.com/unopengis/74): [[Smart Campus]]

### short description

Demonstrate a distributed map hosting environment for equitable [[Smart Campus]] solutions

### overview

We support educational campuses and potentially other premises through equitable smart solutions. We provide a schematic and efficient geospatial data solution ([[Campus Layers]]) to various educational campuses and integrate it with [[dashboard]] feature, [[routing]] feature, and 3D capabilities.

## Objective 5: [[3D Spatial ID]]

### short description

Develop and facilitate 3D geospatial data free flow by extending vector tiles for 3D applications

### overview

We provide a [[3D spatial object model]] for [[3D Spatial ID]]s. It will be available at https://github.com/spatial-id with related libraries and applications. Typical use cases include UAV flight planning and underground utility management.

### key initiatives

- Provide [[3D spatial object model]] implementation at https://github.com/spatial-id.
- Promote applications of [[3D Spatial ID]]s.
- Ideate the use of [[3D Spatial ID]]s in the context of the [[UN Open GIS Initiative]].
- Explore different [[3D Spatial ID]] 'content-type' such as [[3D Tiles]] and [[COPC]].

### key performance indicators

#### Number of software implementations at https://github.com/spatial-id

##### target

3 in 2023-10

#### Number of [[3D Spatial ID]] applications we coordinated

##### target

5 in 2023-10

## Objective 7: Core

### short description

Support all other objectives through understanding and utilizing the OSS and Open Data that is essential to Smart Maps.

### overview

We understand and contribute to a number of OSS and Open Data that are essential to Smart Maps. We will research and prepare OSS and Open Data for other objectives to take advantage of. These OSS and Open Data may be held by several disparate organizations or individuals, but we understand and coordinate their interests. Depending on the situation, we may develop new OSS ourselves.

### key initiatives

- **Understand** and **document** how important each OSS and Open Data is to Smart Maps, including how to utilize it
- **Package** OSS and Open Data for ready-to-use
- **Contribute** to relevant OSS and Open Data

### key performance indicators

- Number of OSS and Open Data we utilized
- Number of OSS and Open Data we contributed
