## Objective 5: [[3D Spatial ID]]

### short description

Develop and facilitate 3D geospatial data free flow by extending vector tiles for 3D applications

### overview

We provide a [[3D spatial object model]] for [[3D Spatial ID]]s. It will be available at https://github.com/spatial-id with related libraries and applications. Typical use cases include UAV flight planning and underground utility management.

### key initiatives

- Provide [[3D spatial object model]] implementation at https://github.com/spatial-id.
- Promote applications of [[3D Spatial ID]]s.
- Ideate the use of [[3D Spatial ID]]s in the context of the [[UN Open GIS Initiative]].
- Explore different [[3D Spatial ID]] 'content-type' such as [[3D Tiles]] and [[COPC]].
