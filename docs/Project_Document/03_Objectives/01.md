## Objective 1: UN operation

### short description

Operationalize [[vector tiles]] in the UN

### overview

We introduce an effective and efficient geospatial data dissemination mechanism for the [[UN field missions]] and the [[UN Secretariat]]. It will be cost-saving for [[the Organization]].

### key initiatives

- [[Vector tile]] production from both UN and [[OpenStreetMap]] data (concordant with the [[UniteMap]].)
- Hosting [[vector tiles]] for open-source map libraries (such as [[MapLibre GL JS]]) and [[ArcGIS]] Geoportal.
- Develop elevation RGB raster tile ([[Terrain Tiles]]) from existing [[DEM]] and contour lines for 3D terrain maps.
- Continuous improvement of the data structure and map style for better operations.

### key performance indicators

#### Regular update of the [[vector tiles]]

##### current

daily for mission areas, twice a week for other areas

##### target

keep regular updates
