## How we operate

We consider [[DWG7]] as an open global practice [[community]] and take a federated approach; participants bring their high-level objectives with clearly defined owners and success criteria to get all the [[DWG]] members on the same page. Participants will get opportunities to share their progress within [[DWG]] and also to the [[UN Open GIS Initiative]] through its [[monthly meetings]].

## Community promises

1. We treat people as equals. Everyone is welcome.
1. We prefer open collaboration.
1. Contributions are esteemed by their merit.
1. We respect [[data producers]].
1. We criticize ideas, not people.
1. We believe in [[fail forward]] to learn and improve.

### Ground rules as a part of community promises

1. We move by [[empathy]] and [[trust]], not by requests.
1. It is OK to use a local language. It is nice to use a common language.

## Community value statement

We support participants:

1. to design, produce, style, host, and optimize [[vector tiles]].
1. to cope with [[resource-limited environments]].
1. to learn about [[use cases]].
1. to have fun.
1. to introduce new ideas.
1. to help each other.
1. to handle images, raster data ([[terrain tiles]]), [[point clouds]], and [[3D city models]], too.
